# Deep Learning Library in C++

Toy deep learning library written in C++ with support for CUDA.

## Getting Started

To get started clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/adajed/DeepLearningCPP.git
```

### Prerequisites

- CUDA 9.0
- g++ 7.3.0

Additional prerequisites for development:
- clang-format 6.0.0
- clang-tidy 6.0.0

### Installing

```
./build/test
```

Or you can ran a debug version:
```
./build/test_debug
```

## Samples

Source code for samples could be found in **samples** directory.
